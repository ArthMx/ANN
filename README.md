# ANN
After having followed the three first courses of the Deep Learning Specizalization on Coursera, I used what I learned to create a Python class that let me create Artificial Neural Network with a lot of flexibility.

 - **AdamANN.py** contains two classes **AdamANN_clf** and **AdamANN_reg**, they can both create ANN for classification and regression respectively.

 - **AdamANN classification test.ipynb** contains a report of the capabilities of the ANN created by AdamANN_clf, with a test on the MNIST dataset.
